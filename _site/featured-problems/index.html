    <h2>Featured Problems</h2>
    <p>At MUSA, we love to talk about tricky math problems of all levels!
    Here's some of our favorite problems. If you can't figure them out yourself,
    try asking at office hours and see if anyone else can make heads or tails of them.</p>
    
    <h4>Towers of boxes</h4>
    <p><strong>Prereqs</strong>: None</p>
    <p>How many different ways can a person stack n cubical boxes if (a) the person must stack all the boxes in the same two dimensional plane, (b) on the bottom layer of boxes, the boxes must be placed side by side with no gaps in between, and (c) on all higher levels, the boxes must be stacked directly on top of an existing box?</p>

    <h4>Homeomorphism classes in <b>R</b><sup>n</sup></h4>
    <p><strong>Prereqs</strong>: Math 104</p>
    <p>We say that two subsets, X and Y, of <b>R</b><sup>n</sup> are <i>homeomorphic</i> if there is a continuous bijection from X to Y whose inverse is also continuous.</p><p>Show that there exist two subsets of <b>R</b><sup>n</sup> which are not homeomorphic, but do have continuous bijections between them.</p>
