    <h4>Homology theories and their applications</h4>
    <p>16 October, 2017 at 6 PM&mdash;740 Evans</p>
    <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Kat Christianson</p>
    <p>Homology is a powerful algebraic tool that arises naturally in a wide range of different areas of modern mathematics. The main goal of this talk is to provide an introduction to how homology theories are defined and how they are used in practice. We will focus on two standard homology theories in algebraic topology as examples. After laying some theoretical foundations for these two homology theories, we will consider a couple applications of those foundations to questions in geometry and commutative algebra.</p>

    <h4>The Fibonacci Sequence modulo p &mdash; Around and around we go</h4>
    <p>9 October, 2017&mdash;740 Evans</p>
    <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Alexander Youcis</p>
    <p>The Fibonacci sequence has, in the past decade or so, taken on an almost meme like quality. That being said, it is an interesting sequence of integers, the structure of which can get surprisingly complex. We will be interested in this talk in what sort of periodicity properties the Fibonacci sequence has. Of course, this can’t be the normal notion of periodicity (since the Fibonacci sequence is increasing). Instead, we mean the periodicity of the sequence modulo a prime p. It turns out that the study of such a problem naturally leads one to consider slightly more sophisticated problems in number theory and algebra.</p>

    <h4>Sharks in the Shallows</h4>
    <p>25 September, 2017&mdash;740 Evans</p>
    <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Sri Kunnawalkam Elayvalli</p>
    <p>I will talk about problems in mathematics that are so easy to state that even your grandmother can understand them, but are so difficult to solve that no one ever in history has solved them. The interesting thing about the problems I will present is that they are not very famous in the public eye (unlike the twin prime conjecure, Goldbach's conjecture, the abc conjecture, and so on). The platter will include problems of various different flavors, like numbers, sets, triangles, points, sums, etc.</p>

    <h4>To Infinity and Beyond &mdash; The strange world of ordinal arithmetic</h4>
    <p>11 September, 2017&mdash;740 Evans</p>
    <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Professor Richard E. Borcherds</p>
    <p>Beyond the usual numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., lie Cantor's countable ordinal numbers ω, ω+1, ..., ω+ω, ..., ε<sub>0</sub>, .... In some way their arithmetic is similar to the natural numbers; one can add, multiply and raise them to powers and define primes and so on. However in other ways their arithmetic looks a little strange; for example, 1+ω < ω+1.</p>
