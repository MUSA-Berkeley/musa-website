    <h1>Math Monday</h1>
    <p>The Math Monday undergraduate lecture series is the flagship event of MUSA. It is a series of talks, every Monday at 5 PM, given by professors and other academics about mathematical research and special topics.</p>

    <h4 class="text-justify" style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Homology theories and their applications</h4>
    <p>Speaker: Kat Christianson </p>
    <p>Date and Room: 16 October, 2017 at 6 PM in 740 Evans</p>
    <p>Abstract: Homology is a powerful algebraic tool that arises naturally in a wide range of different areas of modern mathematics. The main goal of this talk is to provide an introduction to how homology theories are defined and how they are used in practice. We will focus on two standard homology theories in algebraic topology as examples. After laying some theoretical foundations for these two homology theories, we will consider a couple applications of those foundations to questions in geometry and commutative algebra.</p>
    
    <h4 class="text-justify" style="margin-bottom: 15px;">The Fibonacci Sequence modulo p &mdash; Around and around we go</h4>
    <p>Speaker: Alexander Youcis </p>
    <p>Date and Room: 9 October, 2017 in 740 Evans</p>
    <p>Abstract: The Fibonacci sequence has, in the past decade or so, taken on an almost meme like quality. That being said, it is an interesting sequence of integers, the structure of which can get surprisingly complex. We will be interested in this talk in what sort of periodicity properties the Fibonacci sequence has. Of course, this can’t be the normal notion of periodicity (since the Fibonacci sequence is increasing). Instead, we mean the periodicity of the sequence modulo a prime p. It turns out that the study of such a problem naturally leads one to consider slightly more sophisticated problems in number theory and algebra.</p>
    
    <h4 class="text-justify" style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Sharks in the Shallows</h4>
    <p>Speaker: Sri Kunnawalkam Elayvalli </p>
    <p>Date and Room: 25 September, 2017 in 740 Evans</p>
    <p>Abstract: I will talk about problems in mathematics that are so easy to state that even your grandmother can understand them, but are so difficult to solve that no one ever in history has solved them. The interesting thing about the problems I will present is that they are not very famous in the public eye (unlike the twin prime conjecure, Goldbach's conjecture, the abc conjecture, and so on). The platter will include problems of various different flavors, like numbers, sets, triangles, points, sums, etc.</p>
    
    <h4 class="text-justify" style="margin-bottom: 15px;">To Infinity and Beyond &mdash; The strange world of ordinal arithmetic</h4>
    <p>Speaker: Professor Richard E. Borcherds </p>
    <p>Date and Room: 11 September, 2017 in 740 Evans</p>
    <p>Abstract: Beyond the usual numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., lie Cantor's countable ordinal numbers ω, ω+1, ..., ω+ω, ..., ε<sub>0</sub>, .... In some way their arithmetic is similar to the natural numbers; one can add, multiply and raise them to powers and define primes and so on. However in other ways their arithmetic looks a little strange; for example, 1+ω < ω+1.</p>

<img src="/img/ncumc.jpg" class="banner">
<p>
 In Spring 2017, the Mathematical Undergraduate Student Association organized a road trip for math undergraduates to 
attend the <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/nocalumc/norcalumc-home/2017-conference>Northern California 
Undergraduate Mathematics Conference</a>, which was held on March 25 at Sonoma State University. The conference 
provided an opportunity for undergraduates to talk about their senior theses or Directed Reading Program projects. 
In particular, out of 24 student presentations at the conference, 5 were given by Berkeley students:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Mahrud Sayrafi on “Computations in Local Rings using Macaulay2 Software”</li>
 <li>Carl Plant on “Topological Graph Theory as a Lens for Analyzing Voting Rules”</li>
 <li>Hugo Jenkins on “Diophantine Equations from Pascal's Triangle”</li>
 <li>Renjun Zhu &amp; Ana Wright on “Mixing Times For the Generalized Rook's Walk”</li>
 <li>Tram Pham on “Finite Difference Method for Partial Differential Equations”</li>
</ul>
<p>
 The conference included keynote speeches by Francis Su, President of the Mathematical Association of America and Professor at Harvey Mudd College, as well as Cornelia Van Cott, Associate Professor at the University of San Francisco. The trip was partially funded by MUSA and ASUC. Pending increased funding, MUSA intends to organize a trip to the next conference, which will be hosted by Fresno State University."

<h1>Distinguished Teaching Award</h1>
<p>Every year, MUSA awards an instructor in the department with the Distinguished Teaching &amp; Service Award. The purpose of this award is to recognize excellence in teaching. This award is usually  made at Commencement Exercises in the Spring, and will be presented by the president of MUSA. </p>
<p>Individuals may make nominations directly to MUSA through the online ballot. MUSA does not consider emeriti faculty for this award. As the award is given at the end of the academic year, consideration for the instructor's performance throughout both semesters is highly encouraged. </p>
<p>Candidates for this award should provide evidence that they have implemented exemplary teaching in a manner consistent with good practice, initiative, and clairty. The candidate should have had an impact on students and the community both in and out of the classroom.</p>
