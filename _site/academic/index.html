<p>We are committed to improving the academic standing of undergraduate math community at 
Berkeley, especially by filling in where the department does not cover. Some of our academic events are:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=10lVuR_nupTpkj9xLwZN-G7LNga8Cll6hkAg-O6hDI2U">
        REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) Panels;</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/wp/drp/">DRP (Directed Reading Program) Mixers;</a></li>
 <li>Graduate School Panels;</li>
 <li>and themed Recreational Math Nights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Above all, we are proud of our flagship event: Math Monday Undergraduate Lecture Series. 
Math Monday talks are a series of lectures about various topics of research in math and applied math directed 
at undergraduate math students.</p>

    <h2><a href="/math-monday/">Math Monday</a></h2>
    <p>The Math Monday undergraduate lecture series is the flagship event of MUSA. It is a series of talks, every Monday at 5 PM, given by professors and other academics about mathematical research and special topics.</p>

    <h4>What is a quantum metric space?</h4>
    <p>Marc Rieffel</p>
    <p>12 March, 2018&mdash;939 Evans</p>
    <p>I will indicate some issues in high-energy quantum physics that suggest the need for a definition of a “quantum metric space”, and then I will proceed to show how to obtain a useful definition, concentrating on “compact” (and “finite”) ones. I will indicate many examples. If time allows, I will also indicate how to define the distance between compact quantum metric spaces, with examples. This is a relatively new topic, with many aspects remaining to be explored.</p><p>Useful background for my talk is Math 104, 110, and a bit of 113, but this is not necessary. No physics background is needed (though it would be a bit helpful).</p>

    <h2><a href="/musa74/">Transition to Upper-Division Math</a></h2>
     <p>Stepping into your first upper division math course can be a scary thing. Unlike other subjects, the difference between lower and upper division courses in math can be quite overwhelming, the two main culprits being writing proofs and abstract concepts. In this course we will address these issues head-on. In particular, we will learn how to write proofs and develop good mathematical style and we will give students more familiarity withthe mathematical objects appearing in Math 104 and Math 113.</p> 
    <p>MUSA 74 is a seminar taught by MUSA officers, especially Cailan Li, beginning in Spring 2018. It is meant for students currently enrolled in Math 104 or Math 113, to supplement the proof-writing skills needed in those classes.</p>
    <p>MUSA 74 meets Monday in 736 Evans and Friday in 748 Evans, both days 4 PM-5 PM.</p>

<h2>MUSA Goes to NCUMC!</h2>

<img src="/img/ncumc.jpg" class="banner">
<p>
 In Spring 2017, the Mathematical Undergraduate Student Association organized a road trip for math undergraduates to 
attend the <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/nocalumc/norcalumc-home/2017-conference>Northern California 
Undergraduate Mathematics Conference</a>, which was held on March 25 at Sonoma State University. The conference 
provided an opportunity for undergraduates to talk about their senior theses or Directed Reading Program projects. 
In particular, out of 24 student presentations at the conference, 5 were given by Berkeley students:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Mahrud Sayrafi on “Computations in Local Rings using Macaulay2 Software”</li>
 <li>Carl Plant on “Topological Graph Theory as a Lens for Analyzing Voting Rules”</li>
 <li>Hugo Jenkins on “Diophantine Equations from Pascal's Triangle”</li>
 <li>Renjun Zhu &amp; Ana Wright on “Mixing Times For the Generalized Rook's Walk”</li>
 <li>Tram Pham on “Finite Difference Method for Partial Differential Equations”</li>
</ul>
<p>
 The conference included keynote speeches by Francis Su, President of the Mathematical Association of America and Professor at Harvey Mudd College, as well as Cornelia Van Cott, Associate Professor at the University of San Francisco. The trip was partially funded by MUSA and ASUC. Pending increased funding, MUSA intends to organize a trip to the next conference, which will be hosted by Fresno State University."

    <!-- Awards Section -->
    <section id="awards" class="content-section resource">
<h2>Distinguished Teaching Award</h2>
<p>Every year, MUSA awards an instructor in the department with the Distinguished Teaching &amp; Service Award. The purpose of this award is to recognize excellence in teaching. This award is usually  made at Commencement Exercises in the Spring, and will be presented by the president of MUSA. </p>
<p>Individuals may make nominations directly to MUSA through the online ballot. MUSA does not consider emeriti faculty for this award. As the award is given at the end of the academic year, consideration for the instructor's performance throughout both semesters is highly encouraged. </p>
<p>Candidates for this award should provide evidence that they have implemented exemplary teaching in a manner consistent with good practice, initiative, and clairty. The candidate should have had an impact on students and the community both in and out of the classroom.</p>
