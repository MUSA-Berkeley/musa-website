             <h1>Outreach</h1>
    <p>MUSA's outreach team is responsible for holding events that not only improve
    the quality of life for undergraduates here in the math department, but also prospective
    students and math enthusiasts in the general public.</p>
    <p>Most notably, every spring MUSA holds <a href="/shadowing/">Shadow a Math Major Day</a>
    for prospective freshmen. We also are in charge of <a href="/bump/">BUMP</a>, the math
    department's mentoring program.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="bump" class="content-section resource">
    <h2><a href="/bump/">Berkeley Undergraduate Mathementoring Program</a></h2>
      <p>BUMP (function), or the Berkeley Undergraduate Mathementoring Program (for undergraduates not capable of taking initiative out of nervousness),
      is MUSA's mentoring program. </p>
      <p>BUMP mentors, who are junior or senior volunteers, meet with their students, first and second-years, weekly or biweekly.
      MUSA occasionally sponsors special events for BUMP, but mentors and groups of mentors are responsible for holding
      most of the events.</p>
      <p>While signups are closed for Spring 2018, keep an eye on our mailing list if you're interested in the fall!</p>

    <section id="shadowing" class="content-section resource">
    <h2><a href="/shadowing/">Shadow a Math Major Day</a></h1>
      <p>Shadow a Math Major Day is an event held each spring, shortly after UC Berkeley sends out its acceptance letters.
      Prospective math majors visit campus and get to see what life as a math student is really like.
      It's a great opportunity for you to decide if Berkeley is right for you, and if math is right for you -- and if it
      is, how to succeed in a challenging, competitive department.</p>
      <p>This will be the third year of Shadow a Math Major Day. We'll send out information to students admitted as math
      majors as soon as we know who's been admitted; if you plan to major in math but didn't say so on your application,
      we'll have a way for you to contact us once the time comes.</p>
