<h2><a href="/ncumc/">Northern California Undergraduate Math Conference road trip</a></h2>

<img src="/img/ncumc.jpg" class="banner">

<p>Each year, MUSA organizes a road trip for undergraduates to attend the
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nocalumc/">Northern California Undergraduate
Mathematics Conference</a>, which is held in March at a local university. The conferences provides an opportunity
for undergraduates to talk about their senior theses, REUs, or DRP projects.</p>

<p>The trip is partially funded by MUSA and the ASUC.</p>

    <h3>Spring 2018</h3>
    
    <h4>The integers and the 3-sphere</h4>
    <p>Eric Chen</p>
    <p>19 March, 2018&mdash;939 Evans</p>
    <p>Studying the properties of the integers is interesting, but also very hard. Sometimes, instead of staring at lots of equations and identities, it helps to draw a geometric picture of what's going on. In this talk, I will introduce enough fancy words (not that many) to explain how one could think of quadratic reciprocity geometrically. If there's extra time, I'll also say something about more general rings of integers.</p>
    
    <h4>What is a quantum metric space?</h4>
    <p>Marc Rieffel</p>
    <p>12 March, 2018&mdash;939 Evans</p>
    <p>I will indicate some issues in high-energy quantum physics that suggest the need for a definition of a “quantum metric space”, and then I will proceed to show how to obtain a useful definition, concentrating on “compact” (and “finite”) ones. I will indicate many examples. If time allows, I will also indicate how to define the distance between compact quantum metric spaces, with examples. This is a relatively new topic, with many aspects remaining to be explored.</p><p>Useful background for my talk is Math 104, 110, and a bit of 113, but this is not necessary. No physics background is needed (though it would be a bit helpful).</p>
    
    <h4>The maths behind fruit ninja</h4>
    <p>Srivatsav Kunnawalkam</p>
    <p>5 March, 2018&mdash;1015 Evans</p>
    <p>(Note that this Math Monday will occur at <strong>4 PM</strong>!)</p><p>Hilbert, way back in 1900, knew about fruit ninja. Indeed he posed the problem, also known as Hilbert's 3rd problem&#58; "Can you fruit ninja a fruit in the shape of a regular tetrahedron, into a fruit in the shape of a cube?". In this talk, we will attempt to solve this problem using a powerful tool known as linear algebra. We will then discuss about other such questions which involve finite decompositions and reassembling of subsets of $R^n$.</p></p>
    
    <h4>An introduction to ordinal analysis</h4>
    <p>James Walsh</p>
    <p>26 February, 2018&mdash;939 Evans</p>
    <p>Hilbert's Program was an early twentieth century research program with two goals&#58; (i) axiomatize mathematics and (ii) prove the consistency of the axioms by indubitable means. Interest in Hilbert's Program waned after Gödel's discovery that, roughly, no interesting axiomatic theory can be proved consistent on the basis of indubitable means. This discovery sowed the seeds for a refined version of Hilbert's Program known as ordinal analysis. In ordinal analysis, the strength of axiomatic theories is measured and compared by determining what principles are necessary and sufficient for proving their consistency. I will provide a non-technical introduction to the subject with no background knowledge assumed.</p>
    
    <h4>To Infinity and Beyond</h4>
    <p>Clark Lyons</p>
    <p>11 February, 2018&mdash;939 Evans</p>
    <p>In the 19th century, George Cantor first showed that some infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets. He showed that the size of the set of real numbers is larger than the size of the set of natural numbers, but he left open the question of how much larger. It turns out that this question lies at the foundation of mathematics, and determining exactly how large the continuum can be motivated much of the set theory research done in the 20th century. In this talk we will see what the current state of “continuum problem” is. No prerequisite knowledge assumed.</p>
    
    <h4>How to count like a logician</h4>
    <p>Sung Hyup Lee</p>
    <p>5 February, 2018&mdash;939 Evans</p>
    <p>Ramsey's theorem provides a generalisation of the classic pigeonhole principle. This aspect of infinitary combinatorics, which tells us when certain homogeneity properties hold given certain conditions, has lent itself naturally to a slew of results in logic and the foundations of mathematics. In this talk, I plan to give a brief and friendly survey of this interaction.</p>
    
    <h4>Infinite games</h4>
    <p>John R. Steel</p>
    <p>29 January, 2018&mdash;1015 Evans</p>
    <p>We consider games of the following sort. There are two players, I and II, and a payoff set $A$. The players alternate making moves, and at the end of the game have produced an infinite sequence s of moves. Player I wins if and only if $s$ is in $A$. This game is called $G_A$, and it is said to be determined if one of the two players has a winning strategy.</p><p>For which $A$ is $G_A$ determined? The question turns out to be a basic one in the foundations of mathematics. Its answer is intimately connected to the existence of infinities much larger than the countable infinity involved in the description of the game.</p><p>We shall explain this connection further, in a non-technical talk aimed at a general audience.</p>
