            <h1>About us</h1>
<p>We are the Mathematics Undergraduate Student Association of the University of California, Berkeley!</p>
<img src="/img/intro-bg2.jpg" class="banner" alt="We are MUSA!">
<div class="resource">
<p>We strive to improve the overall quality of studying mathematics here as an undergraduate, especially by 
advocating for issues that benefit the entire undergraduate math community, not only the subset that attends our 
events.</p>
<p>Joining MUSA is an excellent way to connect with other math enthusiasts. You can learn about the many 
opportunities for math students, including little tricks that will help you survive the rigorous math curriculum 
here.</p>
<p>We have <a href="/academic/">academic</a>, <a href="/outreach/">outreach</a>, and <a href="/professional/">professional</a>
groups working to provide services to math undergraduates, including our <a href="/math-monday/">Math Monday</a> lecture
series, <a href="/shadowing/">Shadow a Math Major Day</a>, and our biannual alumni panel. Our <a href="/office/">office</a>,
938 Evans, is also usually open, selling hoodies and food &mdash; but we encourage students to come in just
to chat about math or life. We won't bite!</p>
<p>New to Spring 2018, we've begun the <a href="/bump/">Berkeley Undergraduate Mathementoring Program</a>, where
lower division students can get wisdom from juniors and seniors as well as become more involved in the Berkeley
math community. We've also started a seminar, <a href="/musa74/">MUSA 74</a>, for students who want to learn
more about writing proofs as they take Math 104 and Math 113.</p>
<p>We encourage students to come to our <a href="#events">Thursday events</a>, held in 1015 Evans, where
you can meet fellow math geeks and get valuable information.</p>
<p>Most annoucements are done over MUSA's mailing list.</p>

            <h2>Weekly Events</h2>
<p>We hold events every week throughout the semester. Typically, our events are held at 
<strong>6pm-8pm at Evans 1015</strong>, the top floor lounge of Evans Hall. Our upcoming events
can be seen in the calendar.

<h3>Math Monday</h3>
<p><a href="/math-monday/">Archive</a></p>

<h4>The maths behind fruit ninja</h4>
<p>5 March, 2018 &mdash; 1015 Evans</p>
<p>(Note that this Math Monday will occur at <strong>4 PM</strong>!)</p><p>Hilbert, way back in 1900, knew about fruit ninja. Indeed he posed the problem, also known as Hilbert's 3rd problem&#58; "Can you fruit ninja a fruit in the shape of a regular tetrahedron, into a fruit in the shape of a cube?". In this talk, we will attempt to solve this problem using a powerful tool known as linear algebra. We will then discuss about other such questions which involve finite decompositions and reassembling of subsets of $R^n$.</p></p>

<h3>Featured Problem</h3>
<p><a href="/featured-problems/">Archive</a></p>

<h4>Towers of boxes</h4>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: None</p>
<p>How many different ways can a person stack n cubical boxes if (a) the person must stack all the boxes in the same two dimensional plane, (b) on the bottom layer of boxes, the boxes must be placed side by side with no gaps in between, and (c) on all higher levels, the boxes must be stacked directly on top of an existing box?</p>
