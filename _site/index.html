<p>We are the Mathematics Undergraduate Student Association of the University of California, Berkeley!</p>

<div class="resource">
<p>We strive to improve the overall quality of studying mathematics here as an undergraduate, especially by 
advocating for issues that benefit the entire undergraduate math community, not only the subset that attends our 
events.</p>
<p>Joining MUSA is an excellent way to connect with other math enthusiasts. You can learn about the many 
opportunities for math students, including little tricks that will help you survive the rigorous math curriculum 
here.</p>
<p>Our <a href="/office/#officers">officers</a> include <a href="/academic/">academic</a>, <a href="/outreach/">outreach</a>, and <a href="/professional/">professional</a>
groups working to provide services to math undergraduates, including:</p>
<ul class="text-justify">
<li>Our <a href="/math-monday/">Math Monday</a> and <a href="/sperry/">Pauline Sperry</a> lecture series,</li>
<li><a href="/ncumc/">road trips to conferences</a>,</li>
<li><a href="/shadowing/">Shadow a Math Major Day</a>, for admitted high school seniors,</li>
<li>our biannual alumni panel,</li>
<li>the <a href="/bump/">Berkeley Undergraduate Mathementoring Program</a>, where
lower division students can get wisdom from juniors and seniors as well as become more involved in the Berkeley
math community,</li>
<li>and <a href="/musa74/">MUSA 74</a>, for students who want to learn
more about writing proofs as they take Math 104 and Math 113.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="/office/">office</a>,
938 Evans, is also usually open, selling hoodies and food &mdash; but we encourage students to come in just
to chat about math or life. We won't bite!</p>
<p>We encourage students to come to our <a href="#events">Thursday events</a>, held in 1015 Evans, where
you can meet fellow math geeks and get valuable information. Our events are open to the public,
<strong>not just declared math majors</strong> &mdash;
so don't be a stranger!</p>
<p>Most annoucements are done over MUSA's mailing list.</p>

<h4>Differential game theory and how to use PDE to run down pedestrians optimally</h4>
<p>Craig Evans</p>
<p>23 April, 2018 &mdash; 939 Evans</p>
<p>I will discuss how to use certain nonlinear PDE to design optimal strategies for game problems involving differential equations and will in particular explain applications to the <em>homicidal chauffeur</em> problem.</p>

<h3>Featured Problem</h3>
<p><a href="/featured-problems/">Archive</a></p>

<h4>Prison break!</h4>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: None</p>
<p>There are N prisoners in a circular prison; each isolated in their own soundproof prison cell. Each prisoner is given a button and a switch; the button controls the lightbulb in the prisoner one cell clockwise from the button-holder. When a prisoner presses their button, the corresponding lightbulb will flash on and then off at the coming noontime, whenever that is. The goal of the prisoners is to find N; the total number of prisoners. To make things challenging; the prison warden shuffles all the prisoners every night.</p><p>Can this be done; given that you are allowed to give an algorithm A for all the other prisoners to follow; and you yourself can follow an algorithm B?</p>
