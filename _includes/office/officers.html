                    <h1>Officers</h1>
                    <p>We hold office hours and run events with the help of volunteers from the Berkeley mathematics community.</p>
                    <p>Becoming a MUSA officer is a great way to get involved. If you're interested, keep an eye on our
                    mailing list in August!</p>
                <p>We also have an incomplete list of <a href="/former_officers/">former officers</a>.</p>

When I'm not pretending to be serious, I'm running between the MUSA office, the library, and band practice. I'm a senior studying mathematics with a minor in computer science. I play trombone in the Cal Band! I also enjoy playing video games and attempting to have a social life, so please say hi if you see me around campus! I look forward to an amazing year with MUSA!</td>
            <td>Hi all, I’m Ning! As you can tell, I’m the other person who’s not-so-successfully trying to look serious. I’m a Junior doubling majoring in Molecular Cell Biology and Mathematics, and I love talking about either subject separately or as an interdisciplinary study, even if it all goes over my head. I got involved in MUSA freshman year, and fell in love with the variety of people who do math purely because of passion. You can often find me in the MUSA office, so please come and say hi! If you don’t know what to talk to me about, just bring up medicine, piano, cats, nature, or sewing/crafts!</td>
