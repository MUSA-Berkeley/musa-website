<p>We are the Mathematics Undergraduate Student Association of the University of California, Berkeley!</p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/intro-bg2.jpg" style="max-width:7in;" alt="MUSA!">
<p>We strive to improve the overall quality of studying mathematics here as an undergraduate, especially by 
advocating for issues that benefit the entire undergraduate math community, not only the subset that attends our 
events.</p>
<p>Joining MUSA is an excellent way to connect with other math enthusiasts. You can learn about the many 
opportunities for math students, including little tricks that will help you survive the rigorous math curriculum 
here.</p>
