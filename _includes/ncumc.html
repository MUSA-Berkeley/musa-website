<p class="text-justify">
 In Spring 2017, the Mathematical Undergraduate Student Association organized a road trip for math undergraduates to 
attend the <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/nocalumc/norcalumc-home/2017-conference>Northern California 
Undergraduate Mathematics Conference</a>, which was held on March 25 at Sonoma State University. The conference 
provided an opportunity for undergraduates to talk about their senior theses or Directed Reading Program projects. 
In particular, out of 24 student presentations at the conference, 5 were given by Berkeley students:
</p>
<ul class="text-justify">
 <li>Mahrud Sayrafi on “Computations in Local Rings using Macaulay2 Software”</li>
 <li>Carl Plant on “Topological Graph Theory as a Lens for Analyzing Voting Rules”</li>
 <li>Hugo Jenkins on “Diophantine Equations from Pascal's Triangle”</li>
 <li>Renjun Zhu &amp; Ana Wright on “Mixing Times For the Generalized Rook's Walk”</li>
 <li>Tram Pham on “Finite Difference Method for Partial Differential Equations”</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-justify">
 The conference included keynote speeches by Francis Su, President of the Mathematical Association of America and Professor at Harvey Mudd College, as well as Cornelia Van Cott, Associate Professor at the University of San Francisco. The trip was partially funded by MUSA and ASUC. Pending increased funding, MUSA intends to organize a trip to the next conference, which will be hosted by Fresno State University."
