<h2>Website</h2>
<p>The following is a guide for maintaining the website. The guide assumes that you are not using
Windows, or that if you are, you have access to Bash so you can run shell scripts. If not, you're
probably a CS double-major anyways, so figure it out yourself.</p>

<h3>_config.yml &mdash; For officers</h3>
<p>_config.yml is the file you edit to update Math Monday, the Events calendar, and so on. It can
be found in the main directory, /musa_website/.</p>
<p>Similar to SQL, this YML file consists of tables. A typical table looks like this:</p>
<pre>
fields:
-name:       rational numbers
 symbol:     <strong>Q</strong>
 card:       countable
 abs_galois: ???
-name:       Galois field of order p (p a prime)
 symbol:     <strong>Z</strong><sub>p</sup>
 card:       p
 abs_galois: A sexy inverse limit
</pre>
<p>The table is fields, and its rows are "rational numbers" and "Galois field of order p".
Each row contains the entries "name", "symbol", "card", and "abs_galois". Rows are delineated
by hyphens, and cols are delineated by newlines followed by colons.</p>
<p>So to add a new entry, you would, add, below the Galois field entry:</p>
<pre>
-name:       real numbers
 symbol:     <strong>R</strong>
 card:       continuum
 abs_galois: cyclic of order 2
</pre>
<p>Be warned that since linebreaks and - and : are special characters in YML, you can't use
them in the YML file without breaking everything. (Otherwise, this process is idiot-proof,
so seriously don't this!!) Luckily there's an easy fix. Instead of having a linebreak, insert
the HTML <pre></p><p></pre>. Likewise, <pre>&mdash;</pre> is a dash (much better than --!)
and <pre>&#58;</pre> escapes a colon. So you might have something like this:</p>
<pre>
polish_spaces:
-name:   Cantor set
 symbol: 2<sup><strong>N</strong></sup>
 card:   continuum
 desc:   This space is often taught in introductory analysis and topology classes as a useful counterexample&mdash;it is perfect and uncountable but contains no segment and, in fact, can be embedded in <strong>R</strong> to be measure zero.
