<h2>Website</h2>
<p>The following is a guide for maintaining the website. The guide assumes that you are not using
Windows, or that if you are, you have access to Bash so you can run shell scripts. If not, you're
probably a CS double-major anyways, so figure it out yourself.</p>

<h3>_config.yml &mdash; For officers</h3>
<p>_config.yml is the file you edit to update Math Monday, the Events calendar, and so on. It can
be found in the main directory, /musa_website/.</p>
<p>Similar to SQL, this YML file consists of tables. A typical table looks like this:</p>
<pre>
fields:
-name:       rational numbers
 symbol:     &lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;
 card:       countable
 abs_galois: ???
-name:       Galois field of order p (p a prime)
 symbol:     &lt;strong&gt;Z&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;
 card:       p
 abs_galois: A sexy inverse limit
</pre>
<p>The table is fields, and its rows are "rational numbers" and "Galois field of order p".
Each row contains the entries "name", "symbol", "card", and "abs_galois". Rows are delineated
by hyphens, and cols are delineated by newlines followed by colons.</p>

<p>So to add a new entry, you would, add, below the Galois field entry:</p>
<pre>
-name:       real numbers
 symbol:     &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;
 card:       continuum
 abs_galois: cyclic of order 2
</pre>

<p>Once you've finished editing, run ./_build.sh "&lt;your edit summary here&gt;" and enter your
GitHub login to save to the server. Make sure you check online that you didn't break anything
afterwards!</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Be warned that since linebreaks and - and : are special characters in YML, you can't use
them in the YML file without breaking everything. (Otherwise, this process is idiot-proof,
so seriously don't this!!) Luckily there's an easy fix. Instead of having a linebreak, insert
the HTML <code>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;</code>. Likewise, <code>&amp;mdash;</code> is a dash (much better than --!)
and <code>&amp;#58;</code> escapes a colon. Furthermore, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, and <code>&gt;</code>
will not be rendered correctly in HTML, so you need to instead use <code>&amp;lt;</code>, <code>&amp;amp;</code>,
and <code>&amp;gt;</code>.</p>
<p>So you might have something like this (sans linebreaks of course):</p>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap">
polish_spaces:
-name:   Cantor set
 symbol: 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
 card:   continuum
 desc:   This space is often taught in introductory analysis and topology classes as a useful counterexample&mdash;it is perfect and uncountable but contains no segment and, in fact, can be embedded in &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; to be measure zero. The existence of an uncountable Lebesgue null set is enough to imply that if &amp;beta; is the cardinality of the Borel sets and &amp;Gamma; is the cardinality of the measurable sets then &amp;beta; &amp;lt; &amp;Gamma;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a convenient counterexample, the Cantor set satisfies a universal property in the category of compact metrizable spaces (and in particular compact Polish spaces&#58; any such space can be written as the image of 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; under a continuous map. As its symbol suggests, the Cantor set is the countable Cartesian power of the discrete space of cardinality 2.
</pre>
<p>This will render as</p>

<table><tr><td class="img"><h4>CANTOR SET</h4><p>2<sup><strong>N</strong></sup>&mdash;cardinality of the continuum</p></td>

<h3>The file structure &mdash; For webmasters</h3>
<p>Files whose names begin with _ will not be made public. On the other hand, files in _includes can be included using the %include command.
_includes/nav.html and _includes/footer.html will automatically be put in any pages. index.html will show when the site first loads.</p>
<p>CSS is stored in _includes/css/grayscale.css.</p>
<h3>Git, Bash, Jekyll, and all that &mdash; For everyone</h3>
<p>You will need to have Jekyll and Git installed on your computer to edit the website. To run the scripts Mahrud and I have prepared,
you will also need to have access to Bash. If you're on a Mac or in some Linux distribution, this is easy (and insalling git and jekyll
is easy as well, thanks to package managers). If you're on Windows, you're out of luck.</p>
<p>Assuming you have access to Mac or Linux, open the command line and type the following to install Jekyll:</p>
<pre>gem install jekyll bundler</pre>
<p>If you don't have RubyGems (it's built into most machines) you'll have to install Ruby and RubyGems (Google it).</p>
<p>Once you have RubyGems, Jekyll, and Git all running, make a MUSA folder and cd into it, then run the following:</p>
<pre>git clone https://github.com/MUSA-Berkeley/musa-website.git</pre>
<p>Of course this won't do anything if you don't have access to the MUSA repo. Ask your webmaster to add your GitHub account.</p>
<p>From here you can edit files, but if you don't know what something does don't touch it.</p>
<p>To save and upload, type the following from the /musa-website/ directory:</p>
<pre>./_build.sh "&lt;my edit summary&gt;"</pre>
<p>Jekyll will run and build the site in _site. If you broke something, you'll get a red flag; if this happens Ctrl+C out.
Otherwise, it will prompt you for your username and password on GitHub. Enter them, and wait about 15 seconds. Then open your
browser, go to the page you just edited, and hit Ctrl+F5 to purge your cache; this will show you the updated site.</p>
<p>If something goes wrong and you don't know how to use Git, please contact the webmaster instead of trying to merge branches
or something. We don't want a repeat of that one time BMT broke Git, and that one other time BMT broke Git.</p>
