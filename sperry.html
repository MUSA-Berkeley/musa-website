  Where Number Theory Meets Network Optimization</h2>

  4pm in  60 Evans Hall</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 7in; margin: 0 auto"><b>Abstract:</b>
In the early 70’s, the concept of “expander graphs” was introduced as an optimal model for networks of arbitrary 
size.  Back then, it was not even known whether such graphs exist or not.  Today, we not only know that they exist, 
but have seen their importance come up in a great spectrum of fields in mathematics and computer science.  In this 
talk, we will explore what these graphs are and give an idea about how they have recently made a splash on the number
theory scene.

<h2>Biography of Pauline Sperry</h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7e/Pauline_Sperry.jpg" width=200px />
<p style="text-align: justify">
This year marks the centennial of the addition of the first woman to become an associate professor in the Berkeley Math Department – Pauline Sperry. Born in 1885 in Massachusetts, she studied math and music at Smith College, where she later returned for graduate work and teaching mathematics. She continued her graduate studies at the University of Chicago, where she completed her dissertation in projective differential geometry and in 1916 was awarded a doctorate. Then in 1917, a hundred years ago, she joined UC Berkeley as an instructor, promoted to assistant professor in 1923 and eventually to associate professor in 1932, both demonstrating her brilliance in advanced mathematics as the first woman to achieve those positions in Berkeley. By 1950, she had advised five Ph.D. candidates, published a bibliography and two textbooks, and mentored many women in her decades of service to the Berkeley Math Department.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Sperry’s distinguished career came to a premature end in 1950 when she was dismissed for refusing to sign an oath of loyalty at the height of the anti-communist era. She believed as a matter of principle that the oath would encroach on political freedom. After 2 years, the court ruled in her and other nonsigners favor, but as she was already passed the retirement age, she was reinstated as associate professor emerita. Later, the University President Robert G. Sproul praised her “exceptional ability as a teacher in a subject in which the quality of teaching can be responsible in large measure for the difference between brilliance and mediocrity in a student's work.”
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
After retiring from teaching, Sperry dedicated her time to promote human rights through involvement in the American Civil Liberties Union, the League of Women Voters, and the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. A remarkable philanthropist, she also gave to help those in need, claiming that to be happy, one should be “bold enough to ask the right questions, and brave enough to face the answers about the untouchable subject, money. ... Give 'till it hurts!”.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
It is in honor of Professor Sperry’s decades of devotion to teaching, excellence in mathematics, social activism, and her remarkable generosity and spirit that we start this lecture series. Our hope is that her example can serve as a role model for all students of mathematics.

<h2>Biography of Professor Fuchs</h2>
<img src="https://owpdb.mfo.de/photoNormal?id=15691" width=400px />
<p style="text-align: justify">
Professor Elena Fuchs received her B.A. in mathematics here at UC Berkeley in 2005 and earned her Ph.D. in number
 theory from Princeton University before beginning postdoctoral work at the Institute for Advanced Study in 2010. 
Since then, she has held positions at UC Berkeley and University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. In 2016, Professor 
Fuchs was awarded the Sloan Fellowship for early-career researchers and is currently an assistant professor at UC 
Davis.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
A committee member of the Association for Women in Mathematics, Professor Fuchs was the president of Princeton 
University Noetherian Ring and co-founded Princeton Math Circle as a graduate student. Since then, she has been 
involved in various events including a Summer Workshop for Women in Mathematics at Princeton, Illinois Number Theory
Conference, and the 2016 Midwestern Women in Mathematics Symposium as a co-organizer.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Professor Fuchs does research on the interplay between geometric group theory and number theory, such as 
Apollonian gaskets, which are fractals made of circles. In particular, she is interested in arithmetic properties of
integer matrix groups such as various monodromy groups and hyperbolic reflection groups.</p>
